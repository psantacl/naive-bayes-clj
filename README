# bayesian-classifier

An agent based naive bayesian classifier supporting both traditional classification and Paul Graham's variant outlined in "A Plan for Spam"

## Usage

make-classifier accepts N category names as keywords and returns a classifer agent:
(def *health-sick-classifier* (make-classifier :health :sick))

Next, you'll want to give it some training data:
(send *health-sick-classifier* learn "fred" :sick)
(send *health-sick-classifier* learn "juan" :healt)

Finally, use one of the support methods to categorize new data:
(p-of-class-given-token *health-sick-classifier* "betty")
(p-of-class-given-token-graham *health-sick-classifier* "mary")
